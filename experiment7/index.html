				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>I started with one of the examples shown off during my section.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>The initial sketch didn't actually have much to do with my end goal. So I actually got rid of most of it and built something new from scratch.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>Using the code from my integration phase as a jumping off point, I created a visually interesting heatmap that showed the frequency of words in a .txt file by using various parsing and data formatting techniques.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section"> 
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked by myself on the experiment so everything is my own.</li>
					<li>I am pretty happy with this experiment and believe that I was able to find an interesting way to visualize data from a text file.</li>
					<li>The highs were when I got the basic heatmap to work, even if it was using a black, white, and gray color scheme, it showed me my idea was possible. From then on, the highs were just continuing to make the heatmap more visually appealing.</li>
					<li>The lowest point was actually getting the sketch properly integrated onto my webpage because the cell sizes of the heatmap were too large and got cut off, making it impossible to see the entire heatmap on the webpage.</li>
				</ul>
