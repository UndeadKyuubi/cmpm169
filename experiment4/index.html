			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>I started experiment 4 by browsing through Open Processing and finding a few sketches that looked cool that I wanted to try and build on.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>I extended the code from the original sketches by changing the lines for the audio visualizer to an imported image. Then using that image, I enlarge and shrink it to represent and follow the beats of the song.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>I found another sketch on Open Processing that showed me how I could take my imported image and break it down into a bunch of smaller boxes that fly around and then can come back together to reform the whole image.</p>
				<p>Using that, I added it to my own sketch and messed around with it so that my audio visualizer beat effect applied to each of the individual boxes that make up the photo, rather than the photo itself.</p>
				<p>This created a cool pattern where all of the individual boxes would fly across the screen after you broke apart the image and each box would reverberate in time with the song, then when they came together again, the whole image would reverberate as well.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked alone on Experiment 4</li>
					<li>My power went out Saturday and didn't come back on until today (Feb. 7th). I know it is my fault for not working on the experiment before then, but I was not expecting to have to plan for an outage. As a result, since my experiment was already 2 days late, I cared more about just meeting base requirements and not so much about creativity. So I am not as proud of this experiment as my other ones.</li>
					<li>A high was definitely when I got the reverberation effect to work on all of the individual boxes, it was a cool moment seeing all of the boxes break apart and follow the beat of the song. The low was of course, my power going out and not being able to start the experiment until it was already 2 days after the due date.</li>
