			<h1>Experiment 3 - Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>I started by looking through Open Processing and found a cool looking generative noise piece that I thought could make a good foundation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>I extended the code by changing the way the noise was generated to something simpler that I could understand better, as well as incorporating mouse tracking to alter the noise patterns.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>I used the noise generation technique from the integration steps along with the mouse tracking technique to create an aquarium with flowing water altered by the mouse cursor and a bunch of fish that follow the cursor and swim around with some liveliness.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked alone, so everything in this experiment is from me</li>
					<li>I am very happy with this experiment, the water effect overall turned out cool looking and the emergent behaviors of the fish with how I made them move makes them feel more alive. It is fun watching them as they swim.</li>
					<li>The highs of this experiment were definitely when I switched noise generation techniques and discovered a noise pattern I liked even more than the original piece's that was also way simpler and easier to understand.</li>
					<li>Another high was getting the fish to properly swim away from one another if they ever got too close so that they didnt pile up.</li>
					<li>A low point was probably that I could not make the fish swimming themselves produce any sort of fluctuation in the noise, which I would've liked to do.</li>
				</ul>
