			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars & Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>I started with the example of phone text messages popping up on screen shown off during my section.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>I added a shaking effect to the messages, added functionality to click on messages to delete them, and made it so messages come in more frequently as time passes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>I used the starting code along with my integrated techniques to create a little game about deleting scary messages you are receiving before they inevitably overload your screen.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked alone on the experiment so everything is mine.</li>
					<li>I am actually very proud of this one, I felt like I had a pretty neat concept and it turned out like I hoped it would. Furthermore the code needed to make it was surprisingly not all that difficult.</li>
					<li>The highs were probably when I got "scary" messages to start appearing quicker and more frequently than the "happy" ones until eventually the scary ones filled the screen entirely. If I had to pick a low point, it would probably be all of the small tweaking and balancing I had to do to find a good ratio for the increasing frequencies of messages and probability of a "happy" or "scary" message being produced.</li>
				</ul>
