			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation, & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>I started by browsing through Open Processing until I found a cool generative piece using noise. At first I thought I could use noise to achieve what I wanted, but that ended up not being the case and I pivoted later.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>I extended the code by adding onto it and trying to turn it into a solid flat line that randomly lerped between colors. I made it where the line stayed flat until the keyboard was pressed, then it started changing using noise. The way it changed though was not how I expected, so I ended up not using noise in the end.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>The starting code and my adjustments to it gave me a good idea of the direction I wanted to go in. Once I realized the noise was not going to work out, I started thinking about alternate ways in which I could achieve what I wanted. Leading me to using sine curves. Once I started using sine curves I made all of the alterations to it for each keystroke, so that the user could type to create their own unique patterns of sine curves.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I worked alone, so I did everything on this experiment</li>
					<li>Due to work in other classes and the little time I left myself, I could not make this experiment as good as I feel it could've been.</li>
					<li>The high was definitely when I got the sine curves to change with the different keystrokes as it was a portion of what I ultimately envisioned. The lows though were that I originally wanted to make something like a heart rte monitor, but could not get it working, so I had to jump ship and do the sine curve idea instead.</li>
				</ul>
